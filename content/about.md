About
==========================

##Anya
Anya is short for Anna, a Jewish name that means ’God’s blessing’. I used to spell it with a j, like Anja Persson, but then when people started saying it wrong in other countries I changed to a phonetically less ambiguous Anya. Kovalieva is a very common Belarusian last name that means ’smith’, or ’of a smith’ to be precise. In English I’d be quite inconspicuous as Anna Smith. Ms Smith.

I was born in Belarus, then from 2004 till 2014 I lived in Sweden where I studied Interaction design, photography and fine art. After getting my degree I spent five years in Great Britain, where I was working mainly in craft – 3 years as a furniture designer and maker and 3 years as a jeweller (do the math ;)). When they decided to Brexit I waved my Swedish passport at them goodbye and moved to Berlin.
