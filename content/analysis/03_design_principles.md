 Design Principles Analysis
==========================

Assessing website's design and the use of design principles in it is the subject of this assignment. Three portfolio/me-pages are selected for analysis. Finally this page is also analysed.

Selection
-----------------------

The sites selected represent a range of owners and goals, as well as styles and execution design-wise. Diversity was the goal. The main criteria for choosing the sites was that it has to be a me-page/portfolio. Many unprofessional me-pages and blogs I could think of make use of designs available from the platforms that they inhabit, and thus dismissed for the low chance of their goals and purpose being expressed through their design. The chosen sites are all professional sites, representing a branding studio (design and delivering a message is their profession), a self-improvement coach (a site representing a person who is providing services in a personal capacity (not a company)) and an artist portfolio page (similar in goals to the previous choice but very different in audience).

Method
-----------------------

Sources for design principles:
* [Visual Literacy from http://www.educ.kent.edu/](https://dbwebb.se/article/vl.pdf)
* [Design elements and principles, article](https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/)

The sites are briefly studied. The site's design, perceived goals and purpose are recorded and the efficacy of them is judged using personal opinion. Main design principles (dominant in appearance through the site) are identified, recoded and the home page and subpages are compared.

Result
-----------------------

__**Branding studio porfolio**__

![Fjaka branding studio website](%assets_url%/img/design-principles-analysis/fjaka.png){.screenshots}

This site was found via [Best Website Gallery](https://bestwebsite.gallery/) suggested in the course material as a source of inspiration. It was chosen to represent the conscious and skillful/professional design at top level, as expected from a branding agency.  
https://www.fjaka.co/about

**Goal:** Showcase the studio's skill and aesthetic. Give information about studio's services.
**Purpose:** Create an impression of a forward-thinking, playful, desirable and highly skilled service provider. Create beautiful, engaging experiences.

**General impression:** Colourful, Nordic, clean, competent, playful, young, engaging, the extra mile. The design is heavily graphic based, loads of bright colour, flat backgrounds, big fonts and animated effects.

**Is it successful:** I believe the website is eye catching and shows off a thought through design of experience which is very suitable for a branding agency.

**Design principles:** Unity - the areas or topics of information are being grouped (__Unity__) via brightly coloured backgrounds. This repeats consistently through the site (__Repetition__). All the sections are well __Balanced__: first section of the homepage __informally__, balancing the graphic and the text. Some of the pages are __symmetrical__ around the central axis, __formally balanced__. The __Colour__ palette is rich yet harmonious and creates a sense of connected variety.

Overall I judge the website to be engagingly, consistently and successfully designed throughout. It succeeds at conveying necessary information (who, what, why) on the home page, and also is emotionally engaging through it's design.




__**Self-improvement coach page**__

![Ed Latimore coaching website](%assets_url%/img/design-principles-analysis/ed-latimore.png){.screenshots}

This site was found via https://cssdesignawards.com/ and chosen as a one-person/business portfolio.
https://edlatimore.com/

**Goal:** Introduce potential customers to Ed Latiomre and ecourage them to sign up to his newsletter. Share the posts Ed has written. Sell cources and subscriptions.

**Purpose:** Build trust and rapport with the persona of Ed Latimore. Help people overcome their difficulties. Promote a type of a lifestyle.

**General impression:** Energetic, masculine, decisive, concise, approachable. Modern, stylish.

**Is it successful:** In my opinion the website is clean and has some easily accessible functions that justify it's existence - newsletter sign up, blog articles, course gallery/shop. It is reasonably successful in my eyes, however I might not be the audience for it.

**Design principles:** The sight design utilises __unity__ to group the menu items, the page title and differentiate sections via use of a various backgrounds. These backgrounds constitute the site's palette (__colour__) and contribute to a sence of harmony throughough, making subpages and sections easily recognisable as belonging to this specific site(__Repetition__). __Typography__ is used both for the logo and to deliver messages, grab attention throughout. The main bulk of the content is placed __symmetrically__ on the page, although the 'above the fold' area is balanced informally, which repeats in all the pages. I imagine that is to create more interest and engagement. The use of photographs give the site a bit more __depth__ (__perspective__).

The site has a clean and consistent design. It is however quite generic in its appearance and therefore leaves no particular impression. I believe creating more interest with less symmetrical yet well-balanced compositions (for example in 'Discover my content by category'-section on the home page) and better images (more colour, less stock-photo-generic) for header of the articles could help remedy that.  It is also unclear from the contents what EXACTLY Ed Latimore offers to his customers. Is it the newsletter? Is it coaching?

**Artist portfolio**

![Artsis Lotta Törnroth website](%assets_url%/img/design-principles-analysis/lotta.png){.screenshots}

This site belongs to a personal acquaintance and represents the lower end of professional-persona pages.
https://www.lottatornroth.com/

**Goal:** Showcase the artist's latest works (portfolio/showcase). Provide contact information.
**Purpose:** Introduce new audiences to the artist's work. Build credibility via a list of exhibitions and grants.

**General impression:** Reserved, stylish, minimal. Quite generic for this type of site.

**Is it successful:** Törnrot's website is very predictable for a nordic artist - white and minimal. Its conformity calls for some degree of trustworthiness and comfortable familiarity. However it lacks something that would make the artist persona or the work stand out from the score of similar sites.  

**Design principles:** The site is minimal, so the design decisions present are also scarce. The palette is monochromatic, with a barely distinguishable navy blue for highlighting hovered links. This is however a choice as well in regards to site's __colour__. The content is minimal as well and the gallery pages are __symmetrical__ on the vertical axis. A little more is happening in the pages representing a single project: the objects are presented in a __grid__ with horisontal columns. the interest is in the differing __scale__ of the objects within the grid. The images 'zoom in' when hovered, which introduces some 'movement'. The about page is __informally__ balanced above the fold, however the text is very long and becomes unbalanced when scrolled.

The site fails to communicate effectively the what and the why (we know who from the title and the URL). It requires looking for information. This however is somewhat remedied by the fact that this is common for artist portfolio websites, so a viewer in the know will know what they're dealing with and where to look. The sight is extremely minimal, akin to an empty gallery, an suffers from some pitfalls of the minimal designs described in [The Roots of Minimalism in Web Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/roots-minimalism-web-design/), such as an impaired access to necessary information and aesthetically dominant design. However, due to the limited amount of information that is required to be presented and the familiarity of this type of design with its intended audience it is still functioning as a pleasant artist portfolio.


**Own portfolio**

![Student portfolio](%assets_url%/img/design-principles-analysis/my-page.png){.screenshots}

The site you are viewing this analysis from

**Goal:** Showcase the student's skills and completed assignments. Create a coherent design
**Purpose:** Test and learn web design techniques.

**General impression:** Cheerful, light, clean, approachable.

**Is it successful:** The site is easy to read and all the information is easily available. The use of bold graphics and fonts helps to make an impression. Overall I'd say the sight is successful.

**Design principles:** The main page uses __informal balance__ to harmonise the items in the header and the content of the page. The bold black logo top left is balanced out by the bottom-heavy image bottom-right. Report, gallery and analysis pages are __symmetrical__ along the central axis and use __grids__ to organise content. The report and analysis texts, as well as the header use __lines__ to direct the eye. It was my intention to create the sense of lightness and ease of reading using __white space__. The __colour__ palette is consistent throughout using a bright complimentary colour to highlight functionality.

During this analysis I have realised the importance of the impression made by the home page and chose to rearrange it. To balance it out I  placed the image on the right. I am not happy with the use of the white space. I find it hard to design a flowing compositions when the contents are not known from the beginning. I would perhaps considered placements of text, headers and graphic elements all at the same time and set the values from that rather than adjusting them as I go. However I resit the temptation to make everything symmetrical since it makes a design boring and generic.


Analysis
-----------------------

Formal symmetry, grids and unity seem to be the principles that I have identified the most. Colour palettes and informal balance are also common and add dynamic and character to pages.

It is my guess that most websites we come across will contain quite a few design principles in them. It is a language of sorts, a means of communication that some learn consciously, some absorb through exposure and most can understand because it is based on our shared neurology and psychology. Applying SOME design principles isn't difficult. However it is harder to apply them to a degree that the design starts effectively supporting the site's goals and purpose. Quite commonly the goal is to deliver some sort of service or information and the purpose is to build a relationship (often a professional/monetary one). The first is hard when the content is not readily available, and the second when the design is unappealing or too generic. A good design will support both. Design principles like grids, harmony, unity, repetition aid in structuring the content, whereas lines, movement, variety, perspective and informal balance can help with creating dynamic and directing attention. Moreover colours, images and typography will reflect a character that exists as an overlay to the content. Through reflecting on the chosen sites I come to conclusion that a good design is not only pleasing, it is also effective and special.

It's worth noting that not a single site used the same layout throughout the pages. I make a conclusion that design principles are subordinate to content - the content defines which rules can be used effectively, and some elements repeat to connect the pages together.
