__**Drystone chambers**__   [link](https://www.drystone.com/)

![Drystone chambers website, homepage](../image/drystone.png){.screenshots}

**Typography**

Header
- font family: "bliss-heavy", sans-serif;
- font size: 28.8px;

Body
- font family: "plantin-regular", serif
- font size: 14.4px;

The text on the site is a serif font, while the headers are in a sans serif font, just like the text in the logo. The text has a dark gray color, same as the logo.

**Logo**

Text: DRYSTONE

**Colour**

<table class="palette" style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #373737">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #4c4c4c">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #686868">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFFFFF">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FBAC42">
</tr>
</table>

**Images**

The site has flash images for the body background, as well as stock images for various sections. All images are in b&w and the background image is partially tinted with a highlight yellow of the palette.

**Principal design elements and notes**

I would describe the site as wanting to give a solid and conservative impression - for example the use of a heavy bold lined font face for the logo and images of affluent and aged architecture. The layout is symmetric in most cases and relies heavily on grids. The colour scheme is warm yet reserved.

**Typography**

Body:

<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #c8c8d4">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFFFFF">
</tr>
</table>

**Images**

A prominent coloured background image on the homepage and b&w portraits. Other pages are without images.

**Principal design elements and notes**

The homepage with a graphics in the logo, the colourful background image and movement effects in one of the horizontal sections promises a dynamic website. This impression doesn't last - the rest of the pages are text only in a custom colour on white background. The common strategy seems to be dividing content in horizontal sections, which in turn are structured using grids. When there are no sections the page has a 2-3 column layout. The palette is various shades of a toned down, yet rich purple and white. Reserved, yet somewhat more dynamic. The image of modern architecture at night and the palette suggest a desire to project a modern and dynamic character.

<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFFFFF">
</tr>
</table>

**Images**

Color hero images and background images of traditional, aged architecture, the company building and urban green areas, commonly not  related to the content, as well as colour portraits of employees and videos.

**Principal design elements and notes**

The site has a simple palette with a slightly darker bright red and a blueish dark grey for text on white background. The logos sans serif, all capitals font is light and elegant, but the rest of the site seems quite boxy and conservative, which impression is confirmed by the contents of the images. The amount of content is handled with a item-heavy header and horizontal sections of 2-3 columns. This site uses side menus as well.

__**Corker Binning**__ [link](https://www.corkerbinning.com/)

<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFFFFF">
</tr>
</table>

**Images**

No site images, only colour employee portraits.

**Principal design elements and notes**

The site has a hamburger menu in the header with quick links and the menu items that correspond to a horizontal, 1 viewport height section of the homepage. The layout is clear with a background colour and a contrasting lighter colour as a background for the contents. Despite that the site is very flat. The palette is simple with 2 colours with variations and white. The site uses some animation and very large graphic elements comprised of parts of the logo. These elements cover more than one element creating an illusion of depth and linking different sections.

__**Child and Child**__ [link](https://www.childandchild.co.uk/)

Body

**Colour**

<table class="palette" style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">

<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #888888">
<td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFFFFF">
</tr>
</table>

**Images**

Loads of hero-images with both employees and modern urban landscapes. Stock images for sections and articles. The images seem to have been very carefully chosen as they are coherent in style and content throughout the site as well as relevant for where they appear.

**Principal design elements and notes**

The site makes a very bright impression: a balance of white background, a vivid highlight colour and images. Images are used to divide sections and alternate with the white backgrounds. The site uses white space in favour of grids for displaying content, but grids occur for display of multiple items of the same type.

Analysis
-----------------------

Several elements seem to be trending in the analysed websites:

Typography
Sans-serif fonts are predominant and 3 out of 5 sites use the same font for headers and body text. Sans-serif fonts are also commonly used for logos. The use of graphic logos is not common.

Colour
All of the sites have a bright colour in their palette. However in terms of how much the colours are used I would say that the bright colours are used as accents. The palettes are simple with one or two colours. Most text is presented on white, however only one website used absolute black for the text, all others had different shades of dark gray.

Images
Hero and background images are common, mainly with architectural content. Pictures of employees are often done in the same style against a plain background. Most of the home pages have a large image occupying most of its surface (as a hero or background image).

Design elements
3/5 sites had a menu in the header, other 2 had it hidden as a hamburger menu. All of the sites use grids to organise content, and frame similar content in the same background. The use of grids, menus in headers or side-menus is mainly concerned with managing the large amount of content on these websites.  White space is underused - only 2/5 sites are using it more or less successfully. The sites are predominantly flat - i see no shading or other 3d effects, and minimal examples of movement.
